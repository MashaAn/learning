# FizzBuzz in PHP7

Just Fizz-Buzz in PHP. I used PHP 7

## What I learned

* how to write Unit Tests with PHPUnit
* how to write Parametrized Tests
* how to handle Composer

## What I like

* PHP class syntax is nice
* Composer is fun ;-)
* PHPUnit Asserts remind me of hamcrest Matchers, they work really great and are very readable

## What I hate

* lambdas have to be defined as awkward anonymous functions, look even worse than in python
* the use keyword for closures
* filter, map, reduce have to be called as functions instead of methods of a sequence.
