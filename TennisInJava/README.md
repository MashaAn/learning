# Tennis Refactoring Kata in Java

this is my solution for the refactoring kata by Emily Bache.
Get it yourself from her [GitHub!](https://github.com/emilybache/Tennis-Refactoring-Kata) 

I took the Java version and refactored it for myself. It took me about half a day.

# What I learned

- IntelliJ IDEA is a wonderful IDE
- I hate that Java treats unreachable code as an error, not a warning
