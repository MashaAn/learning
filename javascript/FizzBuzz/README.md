# Fizz Buzz with Javascript

I used ES6 and Jasmine for a simple 
implementation of FizzBuzz.

# What I learned

- How to setup npm
- How to use karma
- How jasmine works

I love how JS works nowadays. 
Finally you can design some classes ;-).

The package management is nice as well.
IntelliJ could be a little better prepared to work with JS, 
though.
