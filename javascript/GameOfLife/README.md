# Game of Life in ES6 with Karma

Just the good old Game of Life with JavaScript using ECMAScript6. The whole code was implemented by using TDD in IntelliJ IDEA.

# What I learned

- how npm works
- configuring karma
- downloading new packages is fun ;)
- TDD with Jasmine rocks!
- The last time I used JS was 4~5 years ago. I like the ES6 additions to JS such as classes, lambdas and symbols.
- compared to other languages such as Ruby/Python/Java, the JavaScript support in IDEA/WebStorm feels a little bit lacking. 
  There are fewer refactorings and I have to setup Karma/NPM from the terminal.
