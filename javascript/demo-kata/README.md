# Just a plain template for doing katas in JS

I am using ES6 with Mocha/Chai under Node.
The whole code gets transpiled with Babel
before execution.

There is also an ESLint configuration file with my 
preferred code style.

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Executing the tests

```bash
npm test
```
