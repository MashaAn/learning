# Spring Boot

Just a small example of me writing the popular Fizz-Buzz as a RESTful service using
Spring Boot. 

I started in Java and then migrated to Kotlin.
I left the implementation of the Fizz-Buzz Service in Java for comparison purposes
in project. I find it funny that it has more than twice as many LoC.
