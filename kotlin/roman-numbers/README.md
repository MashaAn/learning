# Roman numbers

This simple kata converts a roman numeral into its arabic counterpart

## What's special?

* I used a chain of rules for the first time for the implementation
    * thanks to Alex for the nice suggestion!
* replaced an awkward while statement with a tail recursion
* usage of fold function instead of a foreach loop
* no variables at all ;-)
