# Fizz Buzz with Python

## Introduction

This is just a simple implementation of the Fizz-Buzz Coding Kata in Python

## Highlights

* Functional Programming of the rules
* Whole implementation was derived by TDD
* parametrized tests with Nose

## What I learned 

* Python refactorings in IntelliJ could be better
* how to work with lists and filter
* parametrized tests in Python are cool though there is a typo in the the package name ;-)
