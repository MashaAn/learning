# Fizz Buzz with Maven

just a simple project using Maven.
I used assertj for my assertions, and oleaster as the testrunner.

## What I learned

* Refactoring in IntelliJ is fun. You can generate a builder auto-magically ;-)
* Organizing dependencies with a pom.xml rocks!
* Guava is cool
* Streaming-API rocks
* Jasmine-like syntax for BDD-style tests is cool!
