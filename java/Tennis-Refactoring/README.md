# Tennis Refactoring Kata in Java

this is my solution for the refactoring kata by Emily Bache.
Get it yourself from her [GitHub!](https://github.com/emilybache/Tennis-Refactoring-Kata) 

I took the Java version and refactored it for myself. It took me about half a day.

# What I learned

- IntelliJ IDEA is a wonderful IDE
- I hate that Java treats unreachable code as an error, not a warning. I like to insert an unconditional return with my refactored version of the code above and see if all tests pass. This is not possible with Java, at least as far as i know :(. I have to add a fake if-statement (if (true)) or comment out the code.
