# Roman Numbers in Java

simple converter for Roman Numbers into their Arabic equivalent

## What I learned

- Streaming API makes the code look much cleaner
- Streaming a String from a range of Integers is much more intuitive than using substring(start, length)
- How to convert a custom iterator to a stream

## What I hate

- I am missing the yield operator that comes with most modern languages. Implementing an own Iterator is a pain in the ass
