# Yahtzee-Kata

This is the scoring of the game yahtzee in Java.
I mainly used this project for learning how to use
streams in Java 8.

## What I learned

* Using Streams out of Arrays
* Difference between IntStream and Stream<Integer> and how to
  convert them to each other ;-)
* Collect a Stream to a Map or HashSet
* How to re-use a Stream (put it into an Array and re-stream it)
