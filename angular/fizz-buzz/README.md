# Fizz-Buzz kata with Angular

implementation of the simple Fizz-Buzz-Kata with Angular. 
The purpose of this whole project setup is to learn how to communicate 
between Express and Angular.

## How to run

```
npm install
npm start
```

## What I've learned

* work with Observables
* use HttpClient
* write async tests
* setup a Express app from scratch
* completely covering the whole thing with tests

## Project Structure

I decided to make two separate projects. The folder backend contains everything 
for the express app, while frontend contains the angular app.
