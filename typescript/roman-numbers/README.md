# Roman Numbers converter with TDD/Mocha

This little implementation converts roman numbers like 
"XII" to their arabic counterpart.

It accepts all popular Roman Numbers and both summation 
and (simple) subtraction rules.

It was completely derived by practicing TDD with many
refactoring parts.

## What's hot?

* Fluent Interface design for all artifacts
* Usage of filter/map/reduce for all iterations
* Mostly TSLint compliant

## What I learned

* Mocha is great for TDD
    * Mocha configuration is easy (not like with Karma)
    * look up test/mocha.opts for the CLI switches I used
    * look at package.json for the test script
* IDE integration in WebStorm is fun
* Chai is a nice assertion framework
    * it can be extended as well!
    * look up test/setup.ts
