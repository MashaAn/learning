        Say you, say me
        Say it for always
        That's the way it should be
        Say you, say me
        Say it together
        Naturally
        I had a dream I had an awesome dream
        People in the park playing games in the dark
        And what they played was a masquerade
        And from behind of walls of doubt a voice was crying out
        Say you, say me
        Say it for always
        That's the way it should be
        Say you, say me
        Say it together
        Naturally
        As we go down life's lonesome highway
        Seems the hardest thing to do is to find a friend or two
        A helping hand - Some one who understands
        That when you feel you've lost your way
        You've got some one there to say "I'll show you"
        Say you, say me
        Say it for always
        That's the way it should be
        Say you, say me
        Say it together
        Naturally
        So you think you know the answers - Oh no
        'Couse the whole world has got you dancing
        That's right - I'm telling you
        It's time to start believing - Oh yes
        Believing who you are: You are a shining star
        Say you, say me
        Say it for always
        That's the way it should be
        Say you, say m
        Say it together
        Naturally
        Say it together... naturally
